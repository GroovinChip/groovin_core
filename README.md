## Why Very Good Core? 🤔

This project is built on Very Good Vetures' [very_good_cli](https://github.com/VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_cli). I've long been frustrated by having to repeat the same steps over and over in my projects that I finally just forked this project and customized it to my liking.
